# Personal Bio Site

This is my personal bio site that was built to display my abilites as a developer as well as showcase projects that I have created or been involved in. 

## Features
- Main page with a short biography as well as list of technologies I am practiced in. 
- Projects page displaying a list of some of my projects, each with either an image or a gif of the site as well as relevant links and details. 
- Music page with album cover and information for each album I have released.
- Podcast page with details for the podcast I am currently cohosting.

(I am particularly proud of how the styling for the main navigation turned out.)
